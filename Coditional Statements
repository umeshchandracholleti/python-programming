types of Coditional statements in Python language:

   1  .  If     statement 
   2  .  Elif   statement
   3  .  else   statement
   
   example like we use in coding and programing part in software development :
   
   
    1 . Equals : a == b
    2 . not Equals: a != b
    3 . Less than : a < b
    4 . greater than: a > b
    5 . Greater than or equal to: a>=b
    
 systax ;
 if condition:
    # execute these statements 
      else:
    # execute these statements 
    
    
@code for if condition :

a = 500
b = 999 
if b > a:
   print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
   print("a and b are equal")
else:
   print(" a is greater than b")
   
   
 @code for AND logic operator in python:
 
 a = 969
 b = 859
 c = 753
 if a > b and c >a:                                  # AND  TT FF TF FT
   print("Both conditions are True ")
 else:
    print("It is not true")
    
@code for OR logic operator in python:    
 a = 969
 b = 859
 c = 753
 if a > b or c >a:                                  # OR  TT FF TF FT
   print("Both conditions are True ")
 else:
    print("It is not true")
    
    
    
@code PASS   # avoiding ERROR keyword.

a = 522
b = 789
if b > a:
   pass            #keyword
